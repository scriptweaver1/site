# Part One: The Awakening

## Scene 1: The Tower Library

*The wind howls outside ancient stone walls. Candles flicker, casting dancing shadows across countless leather-bound tomes.*

**ELARA:** *(turning pages frantically)* It has to be here somewhere. The old texts mentioned a pact—a covenant sealed in dragonfire.

**MASTER ALDRIC:** *(from the doorway)* You shouldn't be in the restricted section, apprentice.

*Elara spins around, hiding the book behind her back.*

**ELARA:** Master Aldric! I was just... researching.

**ALDRIC:** *(walking closer, his robes sweeping the dusty floor)* Researching what, exactly? The Dragon's Covenant is forbidden knowledge. There's a reason we locked those texts away.

**ELARA:** But the dreams, Master. Every night I see them—dragons falling from the sky, cities burning. Something is coming.

*Aldric's expression softens. He looks older in this moment, burdened.*

**ALDRIC:** *(sighing)* You have the Sight. I had hoped... but it seems the blood runs true in you.

**ELARA:** What do you mean?

## Scene 2: The Revelation

*Aldric moves to the window, gazing out at the distant mountains where storm clouds gather.*

**ALDRIC:** Three hundred years ago, humanity and dragonkind forged an alliance. We gave them our magic; they gave us their protection. But alliances built on power rarely last.

**ELARA:** The Great Betrayal. Everyone knows that story—the dragons turned on us.

**ALDRIC:** *(turning sharply)* Is that what they teach now? 

*He laughs bitterly.*

**ALDRIC:** We betrayed *them*, child. Our ancestors, hungry for more power, discovered a way to bind dragons—to enslave them. The war that followed nearly destroyed both our peoples.

**ELARA:** *(clutching the book tighter)* Then why are the dreams returning? Why am I seeing the covenant's seal breaking?

*Thunder rumbles. The candles flicker and die. In the darkness, Aldric's eyes seem to glow.*

**ALDRIC:** Because someone is trying to undo what was done. And if they succeed, there will be no treaty to protect us this time.

## Scene 3: The Choice

*Morning light streams through the tower windows. Elara stands before the Council of Mages, the forbidden book in hand.*

**COUNCILOR THRESH:** This is an outrage! An apprentice, speaking before the Council?

**COUNCILOR MAYA:** Let her speak. The Sight has not manifested in our order for generations. If she truly possesses it...

**ELARA:** *(stepping forward)* I've seen what's coming. In three days' time, the last dragon egg will hatch in the Crystalline Caves. Whoever reaches it first will determine whether the covenant is restored—or shattered forever.

**THRESH:** Impossible. The dragons are extinct.

**ELARA:** No. They're hidden. Waiting. And they're running out of time.

*She opens the book, revealing a map drawn in shimmering ink that seems to move on the page.*

**ELARA:** I'm going to find that egg. With or without the Council's blessing.

*Silence falls over the chamber. Then, slowly, Master Aldric rises.*

**ALDRIC:** Then you won't go alone.

*To be continued...*
